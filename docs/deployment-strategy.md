# Betwizz Flutter Web Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive deployment strategy for the Betwizz Flutter web application, covering SDK installation, dependency management, build processes, optimization, and verification.

## 1. Flutter SDK Installation & Environment Setup

### Automated SDK Installation
The deployment process automatically installs Flutter SDK using the following approach:

- **Version**: Flutter 3.16.0 (stable channel)
- **Installation Path**: `/opt/flutter`
- **Environment Variables**: Automatically configured
- **Web Support**: Enabled by default

### Manual Installation (Development)
For local development environments:

\`\`\`bash
# Download Flutter SDK
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"

# Verify installation
flutter doctor

# Enable web support
flutter config --enable-web
\`\`\`

## 2. Dependency Management Strategy

### Package Resolution
- **Primary**: `flutter pub get` for Flutter packages
- **Secondary**: `npm install` for build tools
- **Caching**: Pub cache optimization for faster builds

### Version Locking
- `pubspec.lock` committed to repository
- Exact version specifications for critical packages
- Regular dependency audits and updates

## 3. Web Application Build Process

### Build Configuration
- **Target**: Web platform with HTML renderer
- **Mode**: Release mode for production
- **Output**: Optimized JavaScript bundles
- **Base HREF**: Configurable for different environments

### Build Optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Asset bundling and compression
- Service worker generation for offline support

## 4. Asset Optimization & SEO

### Image Optimization
- JPEG quality: 85%
- PNG quantization: 60-80% quality range
- WebP conversion for modern browsers
- Responsive image generation

### SEO Implementation
- Dynamic sitemap generation
- Meta tag optimization
- Open Graph protocol support
- Structured data markup

## 5. Build Integrity Verification

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests execution
- Widget tests validation
- Integration tests for critical paths

### Build Verification
- File integrity checks
- Asset validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Security scanning

## Deployment Pipeline Stages

1. **Pre-build**: Environment setup and validation
2. **Build**: Application compilation and optimization
3. **Post-build**: Asset optimization and SEO generation
4. **Verification**: Integrity checks and testing
5. **Deploy**: Platform-specific deployment
